# QueueNode

The concept of `QueueNode` in the context of binary tree construction typically refers to a node within a queue data structure that is used to assist in level-order tree building or traversal.

In level-order tree construction (also known as breadth-first construction), a queue is used to temporarily store the tree nodes as they are being processed. Each `QueueNode` holds a reference to a binary tree node (`treeNode`) and a pointer to the next node in the queue.

### Key Concepts of `QueueNode`:

1. **Purpose**:
   - A `QueueNode` is part of the queue data structure. It helps manage the order in which binary tree nodes are processed for level-order construction or traversal.
2. **Structure**:
   - A `QueueNode` contains:
     - A reference to a **binary tree node** (often referred to as `treeNode`), which represents a node in the binary tree.
     - A **pointer to the next `QueueNode`** in the queue, allowing the queue to link multiple nodes together.

### Example Structure of a `QueueNode`:

```c
struct QueueNode {
    struct Node* treeNode;  // Pointer to the binary tree node
    struct QueueNode* next; // Pointer to the next QueueNode in the queue
};
```

### Example Usage:

When constructing a binary tree from a level-order sequence of values, a queue helps by storing each binary tree node temporarily until its children are assigned.

```c
// Create a new QueueNode
struct QueueNode* newQueueNode(struct Node* treeNode) {
    struct QueueNode* qNode = (struct QueueNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct QueueNode));
    qNode->treeNode = treeNode;
    qNode->next = NULL;
    return qNode;
}

// Example of using QueueNode to manage binary tree construction
struct QueueNode* front = NULL, *rear = NULL;

// Enqueue tree nodes for processing
void enqueue(struct QueueNode** front, struct QueueNode** rear, struct Node* treeNode) {
    struct QueueNode* temp = newQueueNode(treeNode);
    if (*rear == NULL) {
        *front = *rear = temp;
        return;
    }
    (*rear)->next = temp;
    *rear = temp;
}

// Dequeue a node for further processing
struct Node* dequeue(struct QueueNode** front) {
    if (*front == NULL)
        return NULL;
    struct QueueNode* temp = *front;
    *front = (*front)->next;
    struct Node* treeNode = temp->treeNode;
    free(temp);
    return treeNode;
}
```

### Example Scenario:

In the construction of a binary tree using a level-order array, the first element is assigned as the root. The root is then enqueued, and we continue assigning children to the nodes as we dequeue them from the front of the queue.

### In Summary:

- A `QueueNode` is used within a queue to assist in binary tree operations, especially when level-order traversal or construction is required.
- The queue allows you to process tree nodes in the correct order, ensuring that each node gets its children assigned before moving to the next node.
