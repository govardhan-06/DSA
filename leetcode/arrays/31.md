There are three approaches in which the brute force approach would consume a lot of time complexity.
Brute force approach: Find the permutations, then do linear search and then conclude the next permuted array. O(N! \* N)
Better approach: In C++, we have the standard STL library, so using that we can use the next_permuted fn where in we will pass on the first and last position of array
Optimal approach: Implement the logic in code. Here first find the longest prefix match (find the breaking point), then find the element which is just greater than the break point and then reverse the remaining portion of the array.
