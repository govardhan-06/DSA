# Height of Tree Calculation

The height of a binary tree is calculated using a recursive approach. The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the height of a binary tree is calculated, along with a step-by-step breakdown:

### Definition of Height

1. **Leaf Node**: The height of a leaf node (a node with no children) is 0.
2. **Empty Tree**: The height of an empty tree is typically defined as -1 (or sometimes 0, depending on the convention).
3. **Non-Leaf Node**: The height of any other node is defined as `1 + max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree)`.

### Recursive Calculation

To calculate the height of a binary tree, you can use a recursive function. Here’s how the recursion works:

1. **Base Case**: If the node is `NULL`, return -1 (or 0 based on the convention you follow). This signifies the end of a branch.
2. **Recursive Case**: For a non-NULL node:
   - Recursively calculate the height of the left subtree.
   - Recursively calculate the height of the right subtree.
   - Return `1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)`.

### Pseudocode Example

Here's a pseudocode representation of how you might implement this in a function:

```plaintext
function height(node):
    if node is NULL:
        return -1  // or 0 depending on your convention
    leftHeight = height(node.left)
    rightHeight = height(node.right)
    return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)
```

### Visual Example

Consider the following binary tree:

```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \
  D   E
```

- Calculate height step-by-step:
  - **Node D**: No children, so height is `0`.
  - **Node E**: No children, so height is `0`.
  - **Node B**: Height = `1 + max(0, 0) = 1`.
  - **Node C**: No children, so height is `0`.
  - **Node A**: Height = `1 + max(1, 0) = 2`.

### Result

- The height of the tree is `2` (the longest path from the root to a leaf is through node A to either B or C, which includes two edges).

### Complete C Implementation

Here’s the relevant part of the C implementation that calculates the height:

```c
int height(Node* node) {
    if (node == NULL) {
        return -1;  // or return 0, based on your height definition
    }
    int leftHeight = height(node->left);
    int rightHeight = height(node->right);
    return 1 + (leftHeight > rightHeight ? leftHeight : rightHeight);
}
```

### Summary

The height of a binary tree is determined through a depth-first traversal of the tree, using recursion to explore each subtree and calculate their heights. This process ensures that you accurately determine the longest path from the root to any leaf node, allowing you to calculate the height effectively.
